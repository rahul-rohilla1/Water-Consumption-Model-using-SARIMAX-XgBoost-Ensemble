# Time Series Forecasting Project

This folder contains all the essential components of the Time Series Forecasting project. 

## Contents:

1. **EDA on Data**:
    - This section contains exploratory data analysis on the provided datasets. It includes visualizations, statistical summaries, and initial observations about the data.
  
2. **Model on Sectors**:
    - This section includes the modeling process conducted for various sectors. Detailed information about the SARIMA and XGBoost models, their hyperparameters, and the ensemble approach are documented.

3. **Forecasting Report**:
    - A comprehensive report (`forecasting_report.pdf`) that details the methodology, modeling, ensemble approach, and evaluation metrics of the forecasting process.

4. **Metric Image**:
    - An image that visually showcases the performance metrics (MAPE, RMSE, MAE) of the models on the validation data.

5. **Predictions for Next 7 Days**:
    - A file (`predictions.csv`) containing the forecasts for the upcoming 7 days based on the trained models.

6. **Metrics**:
    - A file (`metric.csv`) containing the calculated performance metrics for the models.

## How to navigate:
